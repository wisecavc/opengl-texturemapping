# opengl-texturemapping
Placeholder repository for OpenGL project involving Texture Mapping

This assignment was based off of a template repository provided by OSU's Intro to Computer Graphics course that was 697 MB. Sorting through it to determine the dependencies of my project file is taking some time. As a way for employers to view the code I created, the main file of the code repository and a video demonstrating it's functionality have been attached. Please note that the file attached will likely not be functional by itself until it's dependencies are attached to the repository.

The code demo video can be found [here](https://media.oregonstate.edu/media/t/1_yo5u70r2)
