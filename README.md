# opengl-texturemapping

## Description

This project demonstrates texture mapping in OpenGL using GLSL vertex and fragment shaders. The vertex shader is used to animate a swimming salmon, and the fragment shader is used to paint the eye of the salmon.

This assignment was based off of skeleton code provided by OSU's Intro to Computer Graphics course that was fairly large. As a way for employers to view the code I created efficiently, only the files containing the code I contributed to the skeleton repository and a video demonstrating the project's functionality have been attached. Please note that the file attached will likely not be functional by itself without it's dependencies.

The code demo video can be found [here](https://media.oregonstate.edu/media/t/1_yo5u70r2)
